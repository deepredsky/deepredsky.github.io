I'm a software developer who specialises in web application development using Ruby on Rails.

Originally from Kathmandu, Nepal, I've been working with several tech companies since 2005, and have worked with teams around the world.
Currently, I live in Copenhagen, Denmark

When not working, I love photography and travelling.
