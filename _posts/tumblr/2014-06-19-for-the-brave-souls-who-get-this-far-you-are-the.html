<p>For the brave souls who get this far: You are the chosen ones,<br/>the valiant knights of programming who toil away, without rest,<br/>fixing our most awful code. To you, true saviors, kings of men,<br/>I say this: never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down,<br/>never gonna run around and desert you. Never gonna make you cry,<br/>never gonna say goodbye. Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.</p>
